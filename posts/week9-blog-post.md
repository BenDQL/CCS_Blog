## Respond to "I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS" by Lauren Lee McCarthy

### An Example of Mycelial Creativity

["I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS"](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/I-heard-TALKING-IS-DANGEROUS) by [Lauren Lee McCarthy](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/) is a compelling instance of mycelial creativity. This concept refers to creativity that spreads and evolves organically, much like a mycelial network in nature. This project invites participants to discuss themes of danger, safety, and the future using text-to-speech technology on their phones. The conversations requires more people engage with the text-to-speech process, mirroring the way mycelium spreads and connects disparate elements in an ecosystem. This form of creative interaction fosters a network of voices and ideas, continually expanding and interweaving through the medium of digital communication.

### The Aesthetic Category of Interesting

The project falls into the aesthetic category of "interesting" due to its innovative approach to communication. By substituting traditional speech with scrolling text, McCarthy disrupts the conventional mode of "talking," introducing a new, alternative method. This approach is particularly important during an epidemic, because it provides a safe way for people to interact without physical contact or vocal exchange. The use of text-to-speech not only maintains the essence of conversation but also encourages individuals to engage with each other in new and thought-provoking ways. This deviation from the norm captures attention and invites participants to reconsider the dynamics of human interaction and communication.

## Brainstorm for AT3 Project

### Domain

For my AT3 project, I plan to engage with the community of photography enthusiasts, specifically focusing on beginners. The goal is to create a website where photographers, both novice and experienced, can share their skills and learn from each other. As a photography enthusiast myself, I have noticed a significant gap in communication regarding camera settings among hobbyists. This website aims to bridge that gap by allowing users to share their photos along with the specific camera settings used, facilitating mutual learning and communication.

### Shared Values

Users are encouraged to share their expertise and experiences regarding photography. It forsters a supportive environment where photographers can learn from each other, and it also promotes openness by sharing detailed camera settings and techniques. By showcasing the photos and techniques involved with capturing the photo, it encourages creative expression and experimentation with different photography techniques.

### Existing Repertoire

Currently, information on how to take good photos using specific camera settings is scattered across various websites and forums. These sources often provide limited examples, requiring enthusiasts to search extensively online or from books for specific settings for different subjects or scenes. This is inconvenient for those looking to learn and grow their photography skills quickly.

### Creative Coding Repertoire

I aimed to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a interactive platform where users can upload and browse photos. It serves as a system where camera settings are displayed alongside each photo, possibly using hover effects or clickable tags for detailed information. To enhance the user experience, I plan to employ p5.js library to build features that allow users to zoom in on photos to see finer details. This platform should allow users to share insights and photography techniques, thereby fostering a better culture for mutual learning within the community.
