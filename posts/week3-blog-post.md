## AT1 Concepts

## AT1 Journey

When I encountered Rafaël Rozendaal’s captivating artwork "return reverse .com", it reminded me of the ripples formed when a single raindrop breaks the surface of a quiet pond. Inspired by "return reverse .com", I would like to replicate and expand this effect to be a downpour of vibrant raindrops dancing upon a canva - every colourful droplet, like a gentle stroke from a painter's brush, spreads outwards, creating complex patterns that will eventually fill the entire canvas so to create a unique painting. To do so, I would like to honour and retain the dynamic radial gradients from Rafaël Rozendaal’s original work. But I will create an array of dynamic radial gradients instead of only one gradient, each appearing randomly on the canvas, one by one, to enrich the visual experience.

In Rafaël Rozendaal’s original work, the dynamic radial gradient moves endlessly in a loop. Watching the gradient spread from the center of the canvas, creating ripples before starting a new one, I couldn't help but think of life's constant cycle - people are born, grow, age, and new life begins again. However, my approach differs slightly. Instead of letting the animation repeat endlessly, I would like to capture the beauty of a single moment within this cycle of life. I'll pause the animation at a specific point, preserving the colour pattern of the radial gradient. Through this, I aim to start a dialogue with Rozendaal's work, reflecting on life's ever-changing nature and the importance of cherishing each moment.
