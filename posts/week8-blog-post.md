## which artists / particular works your submission responds

In this assignment, My inspiration came from "Lit in Glitch,” the work of “Glitch Design” from “Sabata Visconti” where they use text as a source for glitch, reimagining important works of literature as animated visualizations. Glitch refers to errors or anomalies in calculators or digital media. Utilizing glitch as a means of expression, this series explores how a seemingly innocuous remark in everyday conversation can inadvertently bring about feelings of sadness or undermine someone's confidence. Through this artwork, I aim to convey the importance of approaching others with positivity and optimism in our lives. A casual remark may have a significant impact on someone else, and I want to emphasize the power of offering encouragement and support to others.
