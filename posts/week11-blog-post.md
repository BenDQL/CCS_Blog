## In what ways might the practice of creative coding attend to problems regarding digital infrastructure?

### Education and Awareness

Creative coding projects can serve as educational tools, making complex infrastructure issues more understandable through interactive elements. This engagement can raise a broader public awareness about the importance of robust digital infrastructure.

### Data Visualisation

By transforming raw data into interactive visualizations, creative coding helps identify and communicate patterns and vulnerabilities within digital infrastructure, aiding informed decision-making.

### Simulation and Modeling

Creative coding can simulate scenarios of real-life problems, helping to plan and optimise infrastructure resilience.

### Community Engagement

Interactive platforms developed through creative coding can encourage public participation, fostering innovative solutions through community input and collaboration. It also fosters a culture of mutual sharing and learning.
