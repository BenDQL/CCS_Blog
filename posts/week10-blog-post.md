## Discussion

### What aspects of the process were frustrating?

After experiencing live coding, I encountered several frustrating aspects. One significant issue was the inconsistency in parameter application for certain effects. Sometimes, adding a parameter would neither trigger an error message nor execute correctly, leading to confusion due to the lack of feedback. This made it difficult to diagnose and resolve issues.

### What aspects of the process were rewarding?

One major benefit was the ability to create in real-time, which significantly boosted inspiration and idea generation. This real-time approach encouraged continuous experimentation and creativity. Additionally, it greatly enhanced team communication and collaboration, as changes could be instantly seen and discussed, fostering a dynamic and interactive development environment.
